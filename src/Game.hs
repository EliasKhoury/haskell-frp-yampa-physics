{-# LANGUAGE Arrows #-}
-- | This module defines the game as a big Signal Function that transforms a
-- Signal carrying a Input 'Controller' information into a Signal carrying
-- 'GameState'.
--
-- There is no randomness in the game, the only input is the user's.
-- 'Controller' is an abstract representation of a basic input device with
-- position information and a /fire/ button.
--
-- The output is defined in 'GameState', and consists of basic information
-- (points, current level, etc.) and a universe of objects.
--
-- Objects are represented as Signal Functions as well ('ObjectSF'). This
-- allows them to react to user input and change with time.  Each object is
-- responsible for itself, but it cannot affect others: objects can watch
-- others, depend on others and react to them, but they cannot /send a
-- message/ or eliminate other objects. However, if you would like to
-- dynamically introduce new elements in the game (for instance, falling
-- powerups that the player must collect before they hit the ground) then it
-- might be a good idea to allow objects not only to /kill themselves/ but
-- also to spawn new object.
--
-- This module contains two sections:
--
--   - A collection of gameplay SFs, which control the core game loop, carry
--   out collision detection, , etc.
--
--   - One SF per game object. These define the elements in the game universe,
--   which can observe other elements, depend on user input, on previous
--   collisions, etc.
--
-- You may want to read the basic definition of 'GameState', 'Controller' and
-- 'ObjectSF' before you attempt to go through this module.

-- ** Game with partial state information

-- | Given an initial list of objects, it runs the game, presenting the output
-- from those objects at all times, notifying any time the ball hits the floor,

--
-- This works as a game loop with a post-processing step. It uses
-- a well-defined initial accumulator and a traditional feedback
-- loop.

-- | Walls. Each wall has a side and a position.

-- ball-through-paper effects (ball going through objects, potentially never
-- coming back), which can be seen if the FPS suddently drops due to CPU load
-- (for instance, if a really major Garbage Collection kicks in.  One potential
-- optimisation is to trigger these with every SF iteration or every rendering,
-- to decrease the workload and thus the likelyhood of BTP effects.
